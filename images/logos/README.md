# Logo

See styleguide at https://crownstone.rocks/presskit. 

## Usage

Use the black on white logo which has a transparent background. Use the .ai or .svg format which has vector graphics. This scales towards the dimensions required. Use of the .png or .jpeg is discouraged but added for your convenience in rare cases.

Do never use a logo of any color! Do NOT use a logo of the color blue either!

Do use a logo in white if there is a background color present. In that case use the blue (#003e52) background.
