# Vision

Crownstone: indoor positioning hardware for smart homes using artificial intelligence to automatically react to someone's presence.

Our first bet is that in the future **indoor positioning** will be a larger market than outdoor positioning (GPS). Very straightforward, our homes and offices will **never be smart** if they do not **know where we are**!

Our second bet is that every device will get a chip, in particular power outlets and lights. A smart outlet brings comfort, safety, and energy savings. There are many more power outlets than smartphones in the world. That's the potential impact of a company like Crownstone! Billions of human acts automated. Billions of energy savings each year!

The core values of Crownstone are saving time, quality time, and transparency. We automate so people have more time. 
We bring comfort and want people to enjoy their homes. We operate customer-centric and privacy-aware. Your data is yours.

# Who are we?

The best way to show who we are is with a little video!
                    
You can follow us as a team on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/crownstones) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CrownstoneRocks). You can follow individual team members on Twitter as well, like [Hans](https://twitter.com/hans_abbink), who loves enterpreneurship, [Peet](https://twitter.com/pmavantooren), who supports many crowdfunding projects, or [Anne](https://twitter.com/annevanrossum), who can't stop talking about robots and artificial intelligence.
                    
Apart from work, if you're into martial arts, drop Bart a message. Peet likes everything that involves audio and Alex is into 3D animations.

# Background

Crownstone has been originally developed by DoBots, has as seed investor [Almende Investments](http://almende-investments.com), is part of the [Rockstart accelerator](http://www.rockstart.com/blog/rockstart-introduces-participants-of-2016-smart-energy-accelerator), and launched as company on the 20th of May 2016.

We recommend that you scroll through the website and the blog to know what the role of our products can be in a business-to-business context. Indoor localisation has wide applicability apart from use at home, including (informal) care, flexible places at work, and preventive maintenance.

We have a very transparent manner of operation. You can find a lot of information about us online, such as the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dobots/crownstone)
where we raised over 70.000 euros for the Crownstones, our [blog]({{ BASE_PATH }}/blog), where we give you a lot of insight into our projects, and our [github repositories](https://github.com/crownstone).

Find pictures and logos on the [press kit]({{ BASE_PATH }}/presskit) page.
