# Vision
                
In the future indoor positioning is going to be bigger than outdoor positioning (GPS). Our homes and offices will never be smart if they do not know where we are! 

There will be a time that every power outlet and light socket will have a chip. A smart outlet brings comfort, safety, and energy savings. There are many, many more power outlets than smartphones in the world. That's the potential impact of a company like Crownstone! Billions of low-energy chips! Billions of energy savings each year!

# Who are we?

The best way to show who we are is with a little video!
                    
You can follow us as a team on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/crownstones) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CrownstoneRocks). You can follow individual team members on Twitter as well, like [Hans](https://twitter.com/hans_abbink), who loves enterpreneurship, [Peet](https://twitter.com/pmavantooren), who supports many crowdfunding projects, or [Anne](https://twitter.com/annevanrossum), who can't stop talking about robots and artificial intelligence.
                    
Apart from work, if you're into martial arts, drop Bart a message. Peet likes everything that involves audio and Alex is into 3D animations.

# Background

Crownstone has been originally developed by DoBots, has as seed investor [Almende Investments](http://almende-investments.com), is part of the [Rockstart accelerator](http://www.rockstart.com/blog/rockstart-introduces-participants-of-2016-smart-energy-accelerator), and launched as company in April 2016.

We recommend that you scroll through the website and the blog to know what the role of our products can be in a business-to-business context. Indoor localisation has wide applicability apart from use at home, including (informal) care, flexible places at work, and preventive maintenance.

We have a very transparent manner of operation. You can find a lot of information about us online, such as the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dobots/crownstone)
where we raised over 70.000 euros for the Crownstones, our [blog]({{ BASE_PATH }}/blog), where we give you a lot of insight into our projects, and our [github repositories](https://github.com/crownstone).

Find pictures and logos on the [press kit]({{ BASE_PATH }}/presskit) page.
