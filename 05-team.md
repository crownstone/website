Our Vision

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin %}

Crownstone designs and manufacturers **indoor positioning** hardware for smart buildings. It uses artificial intelligence to automatically react to someone’s **presence**.

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin %}

##### In the future the market of indoor positioning will be larger than that of outdoor positioning (GPS)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Our homes and offices will never be smart if they do not know where we are!

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin text-right='true'%}

##### Every device will get a chip, in particular power outlets and lights

<p>&nbsp;</p>

There are many more power outlets than smartphones in the world.
A smart home company which solves the smart outlet puzzle will provide billions of chips per year, will automate billions of human acts per year, and will save billions in energy costs per year.
