Crownstone saves you time

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

We like you to **save** time rather than **spend** time on your smart home! Here are some ideas and tips for the "hands-free" use of your lights and devices!

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-end %}

## Sunset

The sunset scene turns on the lights for you when it is getting dark. Of course it does only turn on the lights based on your **presence**!

{% include snippets/container-image-relative-end %}

{% include snippets/slogan-begin background='blue' %}

Safety first!

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin background='blue'%}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='dark' %}

Turn off outlets when **you**, the adult, are not around! Sure, you won't forget to turn off your iron, but knowing that no one can play with it in a dangerous manner means peace of mind!

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-end %}

{% include snippets/centered-image-home img-size='small' img='/images/danger' format='png' img-alt='danger' %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-end %}

{% include snippets/container-image-relative-begin img-bg='/images/nighttime' horizontal-alignment='left' %}

## Nighttime bathroom

Your **wall switch** will **dim** the lights in the night. This is a nice combination of our switchcraft functionality with so-called twilight behaviour.

{% include snippets/container-image-relative-end %}

{% include snippets/slogan-begin %}

Christmas time!

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

Turn on your Christmas tree lights when you are in the living room! You can set a smart **timer** to automatically turn it on after sunset as well.

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-end %}

{% include snippets/centered-image-home img-size='large' img='/images/christmas' format='png' img-alt='christmas' %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-end %}

{% include snippets/container-image-relative-begin img-bg='/images/kids_tv' bg-position='top center' %}

## Bedtime!

Trigger a **go to bed** time for your kids by switching the television off after their favorite program. Secretly, we use this for ourselves as well... Ceiling lights turn off at twelve o'clock; time to go to bed!

{% include snippets/container-image-relative-end %}

{% include snippets/slogan-begin %}

Coming soon!

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

We're constantly adding more functions to the Crownstones so they become **smarter** over time! Coming soon: the Crownstone as a **wake up light**. Use your normal ceiling light to simulate the sunrise in the morning!
