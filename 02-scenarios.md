Let Crownstone help you everyday

Small daily tasks can sometimes create a lot of hassle. Crownstone enables you to run things more **smoothly**. Here are some useful **ideas** and tips on how to use Crownstones not only with your **lights** but also with your **devices**!

## Sunset

With Crownstones your **scenes** can be based on your **presence**! Use a sunset scene  to turn on the lights when someone is present in a room and it is getting dark.   

{% include snippets/container-image-relative-end %}

{% include snippets/slogan-begin blue-bg='true' %}

Safety is  always first!

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin blue-bg='true'%}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin blue-bg='true' %}

The **presence-aware** functionality of the Crownstones can make your home a little safer by turning off specific plugs when you are not around. For example, a particular **outlet** in which the iron is plugged can just be **turned off** when no adults are present.

## Nighttime bathroom

With the **switchcraft** and **twilight** behaviour your **wall switch** will be able to **dim** your lights while it is dark outside.

Christmas time!

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin %}

Use the **presence-aware** feature of the Crownstone to turn on your christmas tree when you are in that room. You can also set up a **smart timer** to automatically turn on your decorative lights after sunset.

## Smarter TV

With Crownstone you can also set a **smart timer** for your TV, which can be useful to trigger a time to **go to bed**. TV is **switched off** at nine oâ€™clock during week days. Time to go to bed kids!
