# Swarm Control - Dancing Robots

In order to illustrate the Robot Dancing feature in our [Swarm Control App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dobots.swarmcontrol), we decided to show it in action.

In the following two videos you can see several robots doing a dance together.
In the video on the left, we control two LEGO Mindstorms NXT, an iRobot Roomba
with Bluetooth, a Wowwee RoboScooper with Brainlink and our home made robot
[Dotty]({{ site.url }}/2012/08/26/the-dotty-robot). In the video on the right, we removed the RoboScooper and added an AR Drone 2.0 instead.
