# Home Assistant

Home Assistant is an open source platform which lets you integrate smart home devices of any kind!

Home Assistant now works with Crownstone. Switching and dimming your Crownstones, getting presence updates, it's all possible in your Home Assistant. Do you already have Philips Hue lights or Fibaro switches? No problem! Home Assistant lets you use Crownstone's **unique presence detection** on room level to create automations with any other device in Home Assistant!

Everything works together, as it should.

## How do I get Home Assistant?

Home Assistant itself is 100% free! To install Home Assistant follow the [Installation guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/).

## Getting started

If you followed the installation guide, your Home Assistant should be up and running! Awesome!

Step 6. Select an Area for your Crownstone devices.
You will see all the names of your Crownstones, Locations and Spheres.

Crownstones will show up as: Crownstone plug or Crownstone built-in
Presence in a Location, will show up as: Location presence
Presence in a Sphere will show up as: Sphere presence

Note that a Home Assistant area is not the same as a Crownstone Location! Crownstone Locations are **only** for Crownstones, while Home Assistant areas are used for all Home Assistant devices! It is recommended to add your Crownstones and Sphere/Location presence to an area with a similar name as your Crownstone locations.
