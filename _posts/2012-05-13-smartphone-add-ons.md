There are more and more add-ons available for smartphones.
We are eagerly awaiting for example the
[Romo](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peterseid/romo-the-smartphone-robot) funded via [kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com). However,
because of European regulations with respect to volume restrictions of
smartphones, the Romo robot had to be redesigned for the European market and
the Romo will arrive somewhere in early June.

Most of the add-ons are sensors which do not have to create a graphical
interface for the user because now they can hitchhike on the nice AMOLED, etc.
screens of a smartphone which the customer does have anyway already. Such as
for example the [Cardio Defender](http://www.everistgenomics.com/content/cardiodefender/summary.htm) from Everist Genomics, the
Tink√© from Zensorium, the
[Zeven Plus](http://www.dexcom.com/seven-plus) glucose meter from Dexcom, the
[v-linc](http://www.valencell.com/) heart rhythm sensor from Valencell, the
micoach smart shoes from Adidas.

Slowly, however there are are also actuators (things with a motor) attached to
the smartphone as an add-on. There is for example the [Xappr gun](http://www.xapprgun.com/), the [Vibease
vibrator](http://www.techinasia.com/vibease-pre-order/), the [Cobra key finder](https://www.cobra.com/detail/cobra-phonetag.cfm) and the
[bikn](http://www.bikn.com/index.php), the Panasonic [rice cooker](http://www.cnet.com/8301-13553_1-57400077-32/smartphone-talks-to-panasonic-rice-cooker/), several PTZ IP cameras, numerous helicopters, the [Parrot
quadrocopter](https://www.parrot.com/global/drones/parrot-ardrone-20-elite-edition), the
[sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/), an underwater robot, the Hydroview (3000
dollar) from Aquabotix, the [Biometerrarium](http://samuelwilkinson.com/biome/), the Orb music player, etcetera, etcetera.

This world of smartphone-enabled devices is booming. A personal computer has
always been, notwithstanding its name, kind of "impersonal". Your computer
does almost have no idea about you or your wishes and plans of the day.
Smartphones however start to cross this bridge. It becomes possible, at least
from a technical point of view, not to let your phone ring if you are at a
specific location or when you are having a date. It is possible to tell you
which route to take on the highway, to advice you about health issues, to
measure your achievements as a sportsman, etc. However, until now your
smarthphone has not so many options to "reach out" to you in the real world.
Fairly basic things like turning the heat and the lights on, giving water to
the plants, vacuum cleaning are still done by people themselves. Devices
should be able to help us better and better. This will become easier the more
devices are attached to the internet. Hence, smartphone-powered devices are
interesting to us. Not in the first place because they can be turned on by you
and me, but especially because they can then be turned on by our robots. Our
vacuum cleaner can turn on the lights to make it easier to the cleaning, which
is on the moment a far-fetched scenario, but definitely in our reach from a
technological point of view. Most important of all, our robots will need to
know us to be really good personal assistants. The time of impersonal
computers is over...

So, if you sell or find an interesting device, feel free to contact us about
the possibilities to make it internet-enabled.
