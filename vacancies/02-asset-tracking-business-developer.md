### Role

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

###### If you subscribe to our vision that the field of **indoor positioning** is likely going to be larger than that of outdoor positioning, this role might be a perfect fit for you. You are a **self-motivated** person who likes to explore the myriad ways in which our technology for pinpointing the position of **Bluetooth** devices indoors can be leveraged to do **asset tracking**. The proliferation of Bluetooth devices means that there are many devices that potentially can be tracked or used as tags on top of originally non-trackable items. Working at Crownstone as a business developer means having the opportunity to create **strong relationships** with big companies around the globe. You'll explore the market, identify and connect with partners implementing asset tracking for different applications. You manage the contact from the first steps and close the deal, and finally maintain a good relationship with them.

### Company

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

###### Crownstone's designs and manufactures products and services for **truly smart buildings**.

###### Crownstone can provide **asset tracking** in a very cost-affordable manner by supporting all kinds of third-party tags. The Crownstone hardware operates as **Bluetooth Low Energy** scanners and propagates information about tags or assets to hubs and then the wider world. We provide our partners with a very affordable asset tracking system that is seamlessly extended to wearable tracking and beyond.
