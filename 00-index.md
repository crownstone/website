## From consumers to businesses! 

Crownstone has changed course. Our services will focus on **OEMs** and **business-to-business**. This brings consequences to our consumer products which are no longer for sale. However, consumers won't be left out in the cold. Below you can find more information regarding the future of our consumers, business partners, and research projects.

Although our consumer products are no longer for sale, our consumers won’t be left out in the cold. We at Crownstone have come up with a strategy, which is the **Crownstone Community**. People within this community are volunteers, and this is what you can expect from it:

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-end %}

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin text-alignment='right' background='blue' %}

It can be found on this [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/TPYfMvV7bD), and it will handle support questions

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-end img='/images/update/discord.png' img-alt='discord' %}


{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin background='blue' %}

The community will maintain the code base of the product line at [GitHub](https://github.com/Crownstone-Community)

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-end img='/images/update/github.png' img-alt='github' %}


{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin text-alignment='right' background='blue' %}

The Crownstone cloud has been centralized on a single TransIP server. The Community will perform the related dev op tasks

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-end img='/images/update/server.png' img-alt='server' %}


{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin background='blue' %}

The Community will also maintain the Crownstone apps for Android and iOS

**Local Cloud**  

One of our latest interesting developments has been the support for a **private cloud** option. Using the [cloud installer](https://github.com/Crownstone-Community/cloud-installer) we have implemented a solution at [Green Energy Park](https://www.greenenergypark.be/) which sends energy and power data toward a **Priva installation** from a local hub. Installation of such hubs is now a breeze!

**Bluetooth asset tracking**

Crownstone developed a **Bluetooth-based asset tracking system** together with our partner [Blyott](https://blyott.com/). This system saves money for the healthcare industry by reducing purchases and search time. One major advantage for our customers is that because we use **Bluetooth mesh**, we do not depend on security-critical Wi-Fi infrastructure. The Bluetooth mesh is entirely self-sufficient.

### DAIS project

<p>&nbsp;</p>

[DAIS](https://dais-project.eu/) (Distributed Artificial Intelligent System) is a pan-European project bringing faster, more secure, and energy-efficient data processing solutions through the development of **edge AI** software and hardware components. The ability of Crownstones to run **microapps** with custom code allows for implementations of in-network localization and application identification in a distributed manner.

### Passive presence detection

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Crownstone and [Gociety](https://www.golivehealth.nl/) are collaborating! Crownstone is responsible for the development of a new compound sensor system for the detection of unusual behavior in households of people with dementia. **Microapps** that propagate data from wireless senior wristbands to a phone (and alarm center) have been developed, and state-of-the-art research is being done on **device-free detection**.

### Brains4Buildings

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This [project](https://brains4buildings.org/) focuses on developing methods to leverage big data from smart meters, BMS, and IoT devices, to reduce energy consumption, increase comfort, respond flexibly to user behavior and local energy supply and demand, and save on installation maintenance costs. **Power and energy visualizations** among others powered by Crownstone data are part of the project goals.
