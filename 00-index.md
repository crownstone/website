### Indoor positioning

Crownstones pinpoint the location of individuals using Bluetooth tags or smart devices by measuring Bluetooth Low Energy signals. This enables to react to presence and proximity. Applications of indoor positioning include healthcare for patient tracking and smart buildings for improved security and automation.

### Asset tracking

Crownstones scan for Bluetooth LE devices within a building. Attach off-the-shelf Bluetooth tags to assets, and Crownstones use Bluetooth mesh to communicate tag locations to a gateway. BLE asset tracking offers cost efficiency, enhanced security, scalability, and future-proofing.

### Energy monitoring

Crownstones extend their functionality to include energy monitoring on device level. Operating within a Bluetooth mesh network, they broadcast energy-related metrics such as current, voltage, power, and power factor to a central hub, facilitating data collection for further analysis.

**Local Cloud**  

One of our latest interesting developments has been the support for a **private cloud** option. Using the [cloud installer](https://github.com/Crownstone-Community/cloud-installer) we have implemented a solution at [Green Energy Park](https://www.greenenergypark.be/) which sends energy and power data toward a **Priva installation** from a local hub. Installation of such hubs is now a breeze!

**Bluetooth asset tracking**

Crownstone developed a **Bluetooth-based asset tracking system** together with our partner [Blyott](https://blyott.com/). This system saves money for the healthcare industry by reducing purchases and search time. One major advantage for our customers is that because we use **Bluetooth mesh**, we do not depend on security-critical Wi-Fi infrastructure. The Bluetooth mesh is entirely self-sufficient.
