Your presence makes a difference

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

Your home sets your lights automatically at **your** desired level, so you never come back to a dark home.  Make any socket and any ceiling light smart by adding a small building block, a **Crownstone**!

## Welcome Home!

Crownstone lets your home react to you. Lamps, ceiling fans, and space heaters can detect your presence through your smartphone and turn on automatically!

Make any light smart

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin background='blue'%}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='dark' %}

Crownstone modules can be placed behind outlets and **ceiling lights**! Not only can the light be of any shape or form, but the light switch will be still operational as well. This is thanks to our so-called "switchcraft" functionality! Moreover, the Crownstone modules use the presence of your smartphone to figure out whether you're in the room. That's how it makes your lights truly smart!

## Sunset

Crownstone turns on the light in the living room when it is getting dark. It only does this when you are actually **there**!

A Crownstone runs apps!

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light' %}

A Crownstone is like a miniaturized smartphone. There are many apps and functions on it and new ones every month! From a twilight mode to energy monitoring, there is something new to discover every time!
