Bluetooth Asset Tracking

##### Crownstones are also able to scan for any Bluetooth LE device in a building. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

###### You can use off-the-shelf Bluetooth tags attached to your assets and the Crownstones communicate over **Bluetooth mesh** the location of those tags towards a gateway. Subsequently, we work together with partners or customers to **integrate** this asset tracking information in your system or cloud.

### Crownstone offers a solution for indoor asset tracking

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The signal strengths with which the assets are observed are communicated over Bluetooth mesh.

- We support up to 32 Crownstones per hub.
- We support up to 256 assets across all our hubs.

This all depends also on update frequency and latency. Please, contact us with the specific requirements for your application.

{% include snippets/how-works-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/how-it-works-begin img="/images/asset-tracking/ble-tag.png" img-alt="bluetooth tag" title="Bluetooth tags" %}

Bluetooth Low Energy tags are attached to **high value assets**. For example: wheelchairs, IV pumps in hospitals, and other devices.

{% include snippets/how-it-works-end %}


{% include snippets/how-it-works-begin img="/images/asset-tracking/built-ins.png" img-alt="Crownstones" title="Crownstones" %}

Crownstones are configured with mesh **security keys** and a **filter** which defines which assets have to be tracked.

{% include snippets/how-it-works-end %}

{% include snippets/how-it-works-begin img="/images/asset-tracking/hub.png" img-alt="Crownstone hub" title="A Gateway" %}

A hub is configured to obtain the encrypted the data from the Crownstones and to send this data **upstream** to the cloud.

We can deliver additional support such as **configuration** within your backend or by providing a **custom uplink** towards your backend on a case by case basis.
We can also provide you with a service level agreement for your application which defines monitoring services for our hardware or our services, include updates of the Crownstone hub software, or implement other application demands.
