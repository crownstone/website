Wireless alarms are used more and more in different fields: healthcare, elderly, offices, facilities, or in specific industries. 
Crownstone offers to companies providing alarm systems to **enhance** their product portfolio with **our technology**. 
This means that solutions using alarm systems can also benefit from the **functionality** of Crownstone.

**Wireless alarms for health care organisations** 

To know the exact location of an emergency in a multi-storey building cannot be done using technologies such as GPS. Using **indoor localization** Crownstones determine where someone is within a building. This can be done as specific as **room level**. 

For health care organizations we provide the **infrastructure**, the Crownstone modules. These modules are **BLE beacons** that send and receive signals. When an alarm button is activated, the nearest Crownstone receives the signal and determines an exact location. 

For this solution we work together with our partner **[SAFE](https://www.safe-app.nl/indoor-lokalisatie/)** who also provides the alarm buttons and the complete functionality through the SAFE-app.

**Wireless alarm for integrators** 

In this segment we work together with **healthcare tech** companies that develop alarm systems and who want to have Crownstone technology on top of their products. Crownstone integrates with **sensors** used in the healthcare sector by hospitals, nursing homes, home care, etc.

We at Crownstone have created a **wireless integration** with sensors from our partner **[Vahlkamp](https://vahlkamp.nl/en/)**. With this integration a bed or chair alarm can be picked up by a **Crownstone-Vahlkamp bridge** and forwarded to any service a health institute finds necessary. This offers a more complete solution for Vahlkamp users. If an institution also uses Crownstones, then **indoor positioning** can be used to provide an alarm based on that.

**Wireless alarms for OEMs with nurse call systems** 

Crownstone integrates with OEMs. Using our expertise in embedded development and analog electronics, we can **design electronics** and **develop firmware** for hardware. This enables OEMs to extend their nurse call systems with our functionality at the same time that these systems keep meeting the requirements of modern care services and which are subject to the standards **DIN 18040-1** and **DIN VDE 0834**.

Alarm buttons can be also used under a business setting in which the signal they emit can serve a different purpose than healthcare. Some of these possible **business applications** are mentioned below.
