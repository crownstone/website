# Wireless alarms for mental care

Personnel in the mental care sector requires a method to send an alarm when a consult with a patient does not go as planned. Wireless buttons can be used in combination with a smartphone to send such an alarm. GPS on the phone is then used to send coordinates to the people rescuing.

This works at the patient's home and outside. However, a mental care organization is a multi-storey building where GPS is not sufficient. The exact location can in this case be pinpointed by using Crownstone's **indoor localization** feature.

Personnel can carry the same emergency button, and in this case, the Crownstone network picks up the alarm (rather than the smartphone) and sends it through. We work together with our partner [SAFE](https://www.safe-app.nl/indoor-lokalisatie/) to make the alarm system seamless in its use by any mental care professional.

# Wireless alarms for elderly care

In the elderly care sector, there are sensors concerning movement, incontinence, and unrest (troubled sounds), that allow personnel to keep an eye on the inhabitants of their nursing home.

Technology in this sector can benefit from the fine-grained positioning information from Crownstone. In situations where the elderly are willing to have a wearable, which can look like beautiful jewelry, it is easy to detect wandering.

Moreover, Crownstone developed a **Crownstone-Vahlkamp** bridge to integrate the sensors that [Vahlkamp](https://vahlkamp.nl/en/) brings to the market. This is not only of interest to elderly care organisations, but also to people who want to have a solution that might work at home. If you're interested in **wireless integrations** (like this one on the so-called *868.2 MHz social alarm band*) for your technology, contact us!

Alarm buttons can be seen as a button that emits a particular signal. This can serve a different purpose than in the care sector. Some examples of **business applications**.
