  - title: In-network localization
    description: The algorithms run on the Crownstone mesh. The integration of the Crownstone mobile iBeacon SDK is relatively simple. Localization can be less accurate. This setup requires a hub to get the localization data towards your servers. This can also localize tags (no SDK required).

  - title: Crownstone as iBeacons
    description: The default localization mechanisms on a smartphone are used. No Crownstone SDK is required. The Crownstones are configured as normal iBeacons. Localization accuracy depends on the smartphone libraries your developer use.

  - title: Centralized localization
    description: The algorithms run on a Crownstone hub or in the cloud. Proximity information is communicated over Bluetooth mesh to a hub. Localization in real-time might be challenging (expect multiple-second delays). This can also localize tags (no SDK required).

Indoor positioning

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

It's the ability of the Crownstones to know **where** someone is when carrying either a smart device or a Bluetooth tag. Crownstones use the position of these smart devices by measuring **Bluetooth Low Energy** signals. This makes it possible for the Crownstones to react to **presence and proximity**.

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-end %}

Requirements for indoor positioning

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin background="blue" %}

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin background="blue"%}

#### For Crownstones to perform indoor positioning the following is required:  

<p>&nbsp;</p>


- We recommend one Crownstone module per 10 - 25m2
- To have Bluetooth enabled in your smartphone or to carry a Bluetooth tag.

The basics

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin text-alignment='right' %}

### Broadcast distance

<p>&nbsp;</p>

A Crownstone or tag can broadcast from 5m to up to 50m while still contributing to indoor positioning.

{% include snippets/full-width-container-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin %}

### Density

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The more Crownstones, the higher the accuracy. As a rule of thumb, **two Crownstones** per room is sufficient for fingerprinting (see below).

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-end img='/images/indoor-positioning-b2b/room.svg' img-alt='room' %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin text-alignment='right' %}

### Wireless fingerprints

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The fingerprint classifier can learn to localize people **per room**. This is often more useful than so-called trilateration and an actual position in meters (or yards).

{% include snippets/full-width-container-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin %}

### Latency

<p>&nbsp;</p>

More Crownstones means fewer misclassifications which means algorithms can make their decisions faster.

### Location and occupancy

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Data provided through our API can give information about the location of a user, or provide information about the occupancy per room.
