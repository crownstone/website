# Project Development

In smart housing projects, Crownstones are integrated in:

* [Smart Villas](https://www.smartvillas.nl/), with the [brochure](https://www.nieuwbouwinschrijving.nl/Assets/Brochures/brochure4203881.pdf)
* [De Tulp](https://wonenindetulp.nl/)
* [Multiversum](http://www.woneninhetmultiversum.nl/)
* [Flamingopoort](https://flamingopoort.nl/)

# Internet of Things

At VolkerWessels Crownstones are integrated in their Internet of Things platform, called Yodiwo. This enables data
to come in about energy consumption, about the presence of people, and about the use of the building in general.
It is possible to use the Yodiwo platform to couple data with actions or to populate visualizations with data.

Read more on this at the [VolkerWessels Use Case]({{ site.url }}/use-case/volkerwessels).

# Tracking of Wearables

In formal care Crownstones can be used for positioning of elderly and sending an alarm to care professionals only
when someone leaves a particular zone. The elderly can wear the Watchi which already has similar functionality 
on the level of GPS outside of the care facilities. 

Read more on this at the [Watchi Use Case]({{ site.url }}/use-case/watchi).

Note that it is possible that an elderly person just uses their own Android or iOS phone. The Crownstone system can
eventually also be used by existing wearables on the market. To know exactly what it can do with an Apple Watch or
other smart devices, contact us.
