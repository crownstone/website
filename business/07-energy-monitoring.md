Crownstone for energy monitoring

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin%}

**Crownstones can also perform energy monitoring per device**

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

*Crownstones form a **bluetooth mesh** and can broadcast **energy data** towards a hub where it can be collected. This energy data includes: current, voltage, power and power factor.*

{% include snippets/two-cols-centered-text-img-begin text-alignment='right' %}

### Maximize energy savings

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Continuous energy monitoring provides on average energy savings of 12% and it can be as high as 30%

### First step to reduce CO2 emissions

<p>&nbsp;</p>

As of January 2018, energy monitoring is mandatory for many companies under the Environmental Management Act

### Make informed energy management decisions

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Access to energy data helps to detect changes in the energy consumption to take further actions

### Comply with energy saving regulations

<p>&nbsp;</p>

As of July 2019, companies and institutions with an energy consumption above a certain threshold, must take all energy-saving measures with a payback period of 5 years or less.

### Crownstone offers a solution for energy monitoring

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The energy data broadcasted towards the hub contains **samples per minute**.

- The hub can function as a **bridge** towards the servers of our business partners. In that case there's no need to hit our API's
- The software on the hub can be **updated remotely** to keep it secure and improvements can be committed (e.g. in bandwidth or accuracy).

How it works

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/margin %}


{% include snippets/global-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/how-it-works-begin img="/images/energy-monitoring/device.png" img-alt="device" title="Devices to monitor" %}

Select the devices you want to perform **energy monitoring** from. The more devices are included, the more accurate the total energy consumption will be.

{% include snippets/how-it-works-end %}


{% include snippets/how-it-works-begin img="/images/energy-monitoring/built-ins.png" img-alt="built ins" title="Crownstones" %}

Crownstones are placed behind the power outlets in which the devices are plugged. Crownstones form a mesh and broadcast **energy data** towards a hub. 

{% include snippets/how-it-works-end %}


{% include snippets/how-it-works-begin img="/images/energy-monitoring/hub.png" img-alt="hub" title="A Gateway" %}

A **configured hub** can send the data directly to the servers of our business partners. Further treatment of the data is performed by our partners.
