* Analog electronics

**Come to Crownstone with a non-connected device and we will make it connected!**  

*Crownstone preferably uses the nRF52 series by **Nordic** for a rapid ready-for-manufacturing (RFM) process. We provide in that case the **bluenet** firmware with **mesh** functionality and firmware updates over the air. The Nordic nRF53 series supports Bluetooth 5.1 Direction Finding, Bluetooth 5 Long Range, NFC, Bluetooth Mesh, Thread, Zigbee, and the nRF9160 supports NB-IoT/LTE-M (using an eSIM).*

**Crownstone has a team of firmware experts that can help you out if your problems are truly tough!**

*You can find the bluenet firmware developed in-house **[online](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/)**, which demonstrates our expertise with writing bootloaders, mesh firmware, firmware updates over the air, security, etc. Crownstone has **firmware experts** who are cross-disciplinary and have university degrees as mathematicians, machine learning experts, computer scientists, and electrical engineers.*

**Crownstone has developed its own products with extreme miniaturization.**

*Our products integrate a power supply, LED dimmer, bistable relay, current and voltage measurement, and a series of protection measures in a **very small** form factor. We can do the same for you. If you need a power supply or a low-energy solution, we can pack a lot in a very small package.*
