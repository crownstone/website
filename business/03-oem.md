##### Come to Crownstone with a non-connected device and we will make it connected! 

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

###### Crownstone preferably uses the nRF52 series by **Nordic** for a rapid ready-for-manufacturing (RFM) process. We provide in that case the **bluenet** firmware with **mesh** functionality, firmware updates over the air. The Nordic nRF53 series supports Bluetooth 5.1 Direction Finding, Bluetooth 5 Long Range, NFC, Bluetooth Mesh, Thread, Zigbee and the nRF9160 supports NB-IoT/LTE-M (using an eSIM).

##### Crownstone has a team of firmware experts that can help you out if your problems are truly tough!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### You can find the bluenet firmware developed in-house **[online](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/)**, which demonstrates our expertise with writing bootloaders, mesh firmware, firmware updates over the air, security, etc. Crownstone has **firmware experts** who are cross-disciplinary and have university degrees as mathematicians, machine learning experts, computer scientists, and electrical engineers.

##### Crownstone has developed its own products with extreme miniaturization.

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

###### Our products integrate a power supply, LED dimmer, bistable relay, current and voltage measurement, and a series of protection measures in a **very small** form factor. We can do the same for you. If you need a power supply, or a low-energy solution, we can pack a lot in a very small package.
