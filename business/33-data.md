# Crownstone

The Crownstones are IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices that can be used to collect big data. At Crownstone we believe that data is the property of their owner and that it is valuable. Hence, people should be able to collect data and be able to profit from it.

## Data

There is a lot of data that can help in building functionality for people. Some types of data are logical in for example healthcare settings, other ones can be useful for everybody. In the Crownstone app streaming this type of data to a cloud server is always **opt-in**. Only when a person actively enables the corresponding switch in the privacy settings, this type of data becomes available to other services.

the end-user profits from it, so they like to opt-in for your service.
