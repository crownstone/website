# Homey

With the Crownstone app for Homey you can have not only Crownstones reacting to **your presence**, but also other devices coupled to your Homey. 
This is possible when using Crownstone within your **Homey flows**. For example, now both your Crownstones and your Philips Hue lights can be switched on when you are in the living room and it is getting dark!

## Getting started

Homey connects to a device by installing an app. Before you can add to Homey any light or other devices that are connected to your Crownstones, choose the **Crownstone app** from the Homey app collection and install it. 
We have included some instructions below for you to get started with the Crownstone app for Homey.

### Adding the Crownstone app to Homey

1. Go to your Homey app and press on the **plus** button located at the top left corner. Then select **New device**.

## Including your Crownstones into a flow

Flows are scenarios in Homey that do things automatically for you. Flows in Homey work via a **when-and-then** principle. 
Let's make a pair of flows where Crownstones are being included.

    
### Presence aware sunset

With this flow you can make your **Philips hue** sunset scene to get activate only when someone is present in a room! 

1. The **When card** will be a Date & time card **The sun sets**.
2. The **And card** will be a Crownstone card of **who is present where**. In this case we want to activate the scene when anybody is present in the room.
3. The **Then card** will be a Philips hue card of **Activate a scene**. Choose your favorite scene for the sunset!

### Automatic cool down

With this flow you can make your fan automatically turning on when someone enters a room and the temperature is within a certain range.

1. The **When card** will be a Crownstone card **who enters where**. Since we want to make it personalized, a person and a room are chosen. You can also choose anybody as person.
2. The **And card** will be a Tado card of **temperature range**. You can set the range at which you want the fan to automatically turn on.
3. The **Then card** will be a **device on** card. In this case your fan.
