# Intramural Care

The Crownstone infrastructure can be used to give people in an elderly care setting additional freedom. Normally people that are suffering from dementia will need to be locked in. It would be great to have a system in place that allows them to walk around and only warn caregivers when they wander off.

# Preliminary demo

A very quick and dirty demo can be seen in the next clip. This shows the localization on a smart watch which uses the Crownstones to track itself.

Information about how the dashboards for the care provider looks like, how the deployment is done within the care setting can all be obtained through our partner Watchi.
