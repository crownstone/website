			<h2>Full-time positions</h2>
			<p>We have three positions available!</p>
			<h3>Sales</h3>
			<p>
			Your role will be to convince large market players (energy, insurance, utility, and telecom companies) to provide cool services and products to their customers. Cool services based on the new tech developed at Crownstone, such as indoor localization, appliance recognition, etc. In our company you will have a lot of autonomy, from identifying low-hanging fruit, tailoring the market proposition, to control over marketing material. You'll work daily with Anne to make all this a success story!
			</p>
			<h3>Electrical engineer</h3>
			<p>
			Apart from the products we have developed we have multiple products in the pipeline that extend the smart home or leverage our expertise in Bluetooth products or allow us to improve our indoor localization and device monitoring offerings. We work together with a lot of Dutch and international companies for productizing and mass production. Expertise in this respect will definitely be a plus! In our roadmap are products such as a 3-phase switch of the Crownstone and an IoT version (4G LTE/NB-IoT) apart from third-party products that neatlessly fit our roadmap.
			</p>
			<h3>Developer</h3>
			<p>
			We have many interesting opportunities for ambitious developers. It's not just coding a front-end! 
			For example, the implementation of an Arduino runtime environment, including updates over the air from the Arduino graphical user interface. Interfacing multiple smart home BLE devices in our infrastructure. These can be radiator valves, door sensors, lights, etc. This means integration on all levels from integrating the devices into the Crownstone mesh to the graphical user interface. Also integration tasks with home assistant, domoticz, openhab, openmotics and IoT frameworks and protocols like IFTTT MQTT.
			</p>
			<h3>Finance</h3>
			<p>
			You want to play a significant role in an innovative company! You like to establish the strategy for internationalization, don't mind enrolling in promising subsidy programs, and are excited about thinking about funding and mutual beneficial collaboration with venture capitalists and international companies... In that case, drop us a note!

			<h2>Jobs</h2>
			<p>
			Crownstone is always looking for talented people with expertise in embedded programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, or statistical physics.
			</p>
			<h2>Interns</h2>
			<p>
			For an internship we have the following requirements:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It must be a graduation (<b>master thesis</b>) project</li>
				<li>European citizen (outside of Europe we pay large fees)</li>
				<li>Final project plan will be written by you and approved by your professor(s)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			For the topics our current master students are working on, see the <a href="{{ site.url }}/team">team</a> page.
			</p>
			<h2>Open applications</h2>
			<p>
			You're welcome! If you have an interesting story that is :-) 
			Please email <script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/var a=new Array("{{ site.contact-job.email[0] }}", "{{ site.contact-job.email[1] }}", "{{ site.contact-job.email[2] }}", "{{ site.contact-job.email[3] }}", "{{ site.contact-job.email[4] }}", "{{ site.contact-job.email[5] }}");document.write("<a href='mailto:");for(i=a.length-1;i>=0;i--){document.write(a[i])}document.write("?subject=Open application'>{{ site.contact-job.name }}</a>");/*]]>*/</script> your motivation.

			<h2>Graduation projects</h2>
			<p>Please, only apply if you live in the Netherlands and in the context of a graduation project. Proficient English is required, Dutch isn't.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you graduate at our place you know much more about machine learning and working for a startup on artificial intelligence techniques does wonders for your resume.
			</p>
			<p>
			And, no, we are not afraid to use Lego or Arduino if that helps us with prototyping! :-)

				<h3>In-network (mesh) localization</h3>
				<p>Crownstones can not only operate as iBeacons, but also as scanning devices that can localize anything that sends out BLE messages, such as wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Jawbone, but also special watches carried by people with dementia). Localization of these devices is very challenging!</p>

				<h3>Deep learning for Machines</h3>
				<p>Crownstones can monitor machines, tools, appliances. This allows them to recognize usage patterns. To do this properly advanced machine learning is required, hence deep learning!

				<h3>Deep learning of Daily Activities</h3>
				<p>Crownstones can detect so-called activities of daily life. They are able to help elderly to turn off devices if they start to forget things and much more!
				A social application of deep learning!
