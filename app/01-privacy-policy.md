# APP PRIVACY POLICY

See also our [Terms of Service]({{site.url}}/terms-of-service), [Ethical Policy]({{site.url}}/ethical-policy) and our [Privacy Policy]({{site.url}}/privacy-policy).
This page describes our app privacy policy.

Summarized, we do **not sell** your data, we do **not share** your data, we do **not want** your data. 
Your data is only used to provide you with particular functionality that you want. 
We consider you the owner of your data.

## SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?

The Crownstones you have bought have a companion Crownstone app. This app can create a smart home experience using *indoor positioning*. That is, you can walk into a room and automatically the lights go on. To be able to do this technically, we need the location permissions in the Crownstone app enabled. The app collects location data to enable indoor positioning, even when the app is in the background.

The location data is used to provide you with your smart home functionality. The location data can be shared to other household members depending on your own permission settings. The location data is not used for ads.

<p>
We do not collect any data to be sold to third-parties or used for advertisement purposes. All data that is present in the cloud can be queried by the user and deleted by the user. If you need help with the deletion of your account, including all data, contact us at
{% include snippets/email subject="Legal" email=email %}
or by mail at Crownstone, {{ site.company.address }}.
</p>

## SECTION 2 - CONSENT

When downloading and using the Crownstone app, we ask for your consent by using the permission system of the market place owners. 

If, after you opt-in, you change your mind, you can withdraw your consent by removing the app from your smartphone or tablet.

## SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE

We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so.

## SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES

Your data is stored on your phone. To make sure that the Crownstones do not need to be configured by multiple people in the same household, certain configuration data is stored on our servers (see also section 1).
Our apps are hosted by Apple (<https://www.apple.com/privacy/>) and Google (<https://policies.google.com/privacy>).

## SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

We do make use of React for app development. The source code of the app can be found at <https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-app>. We do not integrate services that collect data for third-parties except for one that allows us to catch errors in the field, Sentry (<https://sentry.io/privacy/>).

## SECTION 6 - SECURITY

Communication between the app and the Crownstone hardware is encrypted by the industry's best practices.

## SECTION 7 - COOKIES

The app does not make use of cookies.

## SECTION 8 - AGE OF CONSENT

By using Crownstone services, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.

## SECTION 9 - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.
If Crownstone or third-parties are acquired or merged with other companies, your information may be transferred to the new owners for continued service. Please, read the privacy policy at regular times to understand your rights.

## SECTION 10 - GDPR COMPLIANCE

Crownstone operates GDPR compliant and evokes [article 6](https://gdpr.eu/article-6-how-to-process-personal-data-legally/) on the lawfullness of processing.

In our case, processing is lawfull, because:

- the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
- processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.

The personal data used is to permit the customer to have a truly smart home reacting to their presence. Crownstone 
sells hardware with the promise that it can react to the presence of the user and henceforth carries a legal obligation
to implement given functionality. 

According to GDPR regulation, the customer can withdraw consent.
