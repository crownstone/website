# Forum

We have been using Slack before, but found **Discord** to be a more pleasant experience. You are welcome at our new server, called Crownstone Community which you find through this [invite link](https://discord.gg/TPYfMvV7bD).

The server is more a chat server than a forum actually. However, it has benefits on top of a forum. One of them is that it is easy to also have a quick videocall if you run into trouble as a user or as a developer.

Welcome!
