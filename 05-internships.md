Are you ready for an exciting internship?

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin text-alignment='right'%}

Then check out our available **internships** and **graduation projects**! We’re a no-nonsense team (no long story about how great we are) and you’ll put your **knowledge** into practice at the same time that you **enjoy learning**!

Graduation projects

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

We have several graduation projects available. If you graduate at our place you will learn a lot about machine learning and working for a startup on artificial intelligence techniques does wonders for your resume. Please, only apply if you live in the **Netherlands** and in the context of a **graduation project**. Proficient English is required, Dutch isn’t.

{% include snippets/internship-begin img="/images/internships/network.jpg" img-alt="network-localization" title="In-network localization" %}

Crownstones can not only operate as iBeacons, but also as scanning devices that can localize anything that sends out BLE messages, such as wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Jawbone, but also special watches carried by people with dementia).

{% include snippets/internship-end pdf-link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hx9MgrsoVnLQxju43YvXe0w8ADPw_iBMtMdZqjW3dIw/export?format=pdf" %}


{% include snippets/internship-begin img="/images/internships/machine.jpg" img-alt="deep-learning" title="Deep learning for Machines" %}

Crownstones can monitor different types of devices such as machines, tools, appliances, etc. This allows them to recognize usage patterns. To do this properly advanced machine learning is required, hence deep learning!

{% include snippets/internship-end pdf-link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hx9MgrsoVnLQxju43YvXe0w8ADPw_iBMtMdZqjW3dIw/export?format=pdf" %}


{% include snippets/internship-begin img="/images/internships/device.jpg" img-alt="device" title="Device Identification" %}

Crownstones can distinguish devices based on a “footprint” of current and voltage levels over time. To do this properly advanced machine learning is required, hence deep learning!

{% include snippets/internship-begin img="/images/internships/presence.jpg" img-alt="presence" title="Passive Presence Detection" %}

It is possible to infer from Bluetooth disturbances alone that there are people around, magic! If you want to learn a lot about state-of-the-art signal processing, this is your project!

{% include snippets/internship-end pdf-link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ueT68ln1fLUbdVk4uW5Ohai09G7xjJr3o504Dlv_J2U/export?format=pdf" %}

If a graduation position has been taken, this does not mean that all problems have been solved. These are **multifaceted problems** that require a lot of people to tackle. If something captures your interest, let us know!

### Requirements

- You’re studying at a **European** educational institute (non-EU is not an option).
- Final project plan will be written by **you** and approved by your professor(s).
- In case of a graduation project, it must be your **master thesis.**

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

The internships below are not necessarily tied to a graduation project. They range from a minimum of 3 months to 12 months. If one of them catch your attention, don't hesitate to get in contact with us!

{% include snippets/internship-project-begin img="/images/internships/power.svg" img-alt="power-monitoring" title="Power Monitoring" %}

A nice assignment for an electrical engineering student at HBO level or beyond. Knowledge of Altium is required. You will learn to (1) design a simple board to read out smart meter data and to (2) design a complex board to measure power inductively.

{% include snippets/internship-project-end pdf-link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mBpddjCNsu16h54GJ0SducPJ_eBEnQ-jRb8agE6R8DM/export?format=pdf" %}


{% include snippets/internship-project-begin img="/images/internships/router.svg" img-alt="router" title="KNX" %}

If you have done the minor domotica at Utrecht, this is a perfect assignment for you. You'll apply your knowledge about KNX to connect it with the Crownstone system. This would allow any KNX installation to make use of our indoor localization functions!

{% include snippets/internship-project-end pdf-link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/125ehPizznziib5y5g_qy1pnDHlELFvXeDPBlIlzRrj0/export?format=pdf" %}


{% include snippets/internship-project-begin img="/images/internships/arduino.svg" img-alt="arduino" title="Microapp store" %}

A new upcoming feature of Crownstone is that they can run code written using the Arduino environment. These are called microapps. People should be able to use microapps from others. For this we need a complex frontend and backend. Ideal if you want to become a typescript expert!

{% include snippets/internship-project-end pdf-link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OJ8LOJtUe1WAHl2SsoJWk_ybcw1aJCa76u8io5mPYM4/export?format=pdf" %}


{% include snippets/internship-project-begin img="/images/internships/node-red.svg" img-alt="node-red" title="Node-red" %}

Crownstone is integrated with Google Home, Alexa, and Home Assistant. Node-RED is a home automation platform that is used a lot internationally. The preferred way to incorporate it is by providing an MQTT interface and integrate with that.

{% include snippets/internship-project-end pdf-link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5NKftzUI22oxefR_hGX-asgg1HBY7flgQ-r8PJvFmQ/export?format=pdf" taken="true"%}


{% include snippets/internship-project-begin img="/images/internships/smart-things.svg" img-alt="smart-things" title="SmartThings" %}

The SmartThings hub by Samsung is a home automation hub that is sold as much as the Homey in the Netherlands. You'll be integrating with this hub using the Crownstone cloud services. Bluetooth is not enabled on the hub, but who knows, maybe you'll be able to convince engineers at Samsung to enable it as well!

{% include snippets/internship-project-begin img="/images/internships/communication.svg" img-alt="communication" title="Crownstone Communication" %}

Create a professional style guide for internal and external use building on buyer personas, consolidating the brand’s value, core principles, and establishing the brand’s voice.
