Crownstone is always looking for talented people with expertise in embedded programming, AI or machine learning. If you send us a motivation letter with links to past projects on GitHub, or have done Kaggle competitions, this is a big plus! We have just one requirement: a European work permit (non-EU is a [bureaucratic nightmare and noncompetitive](https://expatlaw.nl/dutch-highly-skilled-migrant)).

{% include snippets/job-vacancy-begin img="/images/electrical-engineer.jpg" img-alt="electrical-engineer" title="Electrical Engineer" %}

In this role you will help us developing products that extend the smart home, leverage our expertise in Bluetooth products or allow us to improve our indoor localization and device monitoring offerings. 
Some of these products are a 3-phase switch of the Crownstone and an IoT version (4G LTE/NB-IoT) apart from third-party products that neatlessly fit our roadmap. 
We work together with Dutch and international companies for productizing and mass production. Expertise in this respect will definitely be a plus!

Your role will be to convince large market players (energy, insurance, utility, and telecom companies) to provide cool services and products to their customers. 
Cool services based on the new tech developed at Crownstone, such as indoor localization, appliance recognition, etc. 
In our company you will have a lot of autonomy, from identifying low-hanging fruit, tailoring the market proposition, to control over marketing material. 
You’ll work daily with Anne to make all this a success story!
