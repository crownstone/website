# Logo

![Crownstone Default Logo]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text_black.svg "Crownstone Default Logo, a Crown symbol by 5 dots connected through lines"){: style="max-width:40%" .float-right}

The following logos can be downloaded (see styleguide below). 

* A **black** logo with text in [Adobe Illustrator format]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text.ai).
* A **black** logo with text as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text_black.svg).
* A **white** logo with text as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text_white.svg). Use only when there is a colored background.
* A **black** logo as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_black.svg). Use only when the brand name is already clearly presented.
* A **white** logo as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_white.svg). Use only when the brand name is already clearly presented and there is a colored background.

Do not use a colored logo! The **black** logo should always be the prefered logo. Only use the white logo if its necessary.

# Styleguide

![Crownstone Styleguide]({{ site.url }}/attachments/crownstone_styleguide.png "Crownstone Styleguide"){: style="width:40%" .float-right}

There are the usual considerations, just a few:

* Use a **black** logo on a **white** background, especially on products or material that does not benefit from color. 
* Logo is **white** on a blue background in the case where the logo really needs to pop out.
* Do not use the logo in any color. The logo is either **black** or **white**.
* Use **bands** over the full width, do not use a circle around the logo. 
* Only use a **few colors** in supporting photographs and use brand colors.
* The brand colors are a shade of blue, **#003e52**, and the complementary shade of orange, **#ff8400**.
* Use the orange shade as an accent, e.g. for line separation, emphasis, not as a primary color. 
* Use **Lato medium** as a font.
* Use the blue font on summaries or accentuated text. Use just a **black font** wherever possible for the primary text.
* In case where lighter shades of colors are required. Go to the [Adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=0&rule=Analogous&selected=3&name=My%20Color%20Theme&mode=rgb&rgbvalues=1,0.5176470588235295,0,0,0.23631049943210286,0.32156862745098036,0.5321115173241195,1,0.04999999999999993,0.8844330991828997,0.04999999999999993,1,0.050000000000000044,0.7437521349992267,1&swatchOrder=1,0,2,3,4). Click on "HSB" and adjust the second row. This will only adjust the **saturation** of a color, not the hue.

# Colors

* Dark blue: #003e52
* Orange: #ff8400

# Brochures

For an example of a brochure that is created using the above styleguide see:

* [Crownstone Brochure Smart Home]({{ site.url }}/attachments/brochures/Crownstone_Brochure_SmartHome.pdf)
* [Crownstone Brochure Green Home]({{ site.url }}/attachments/brochures/Crownstone_Brochure_GreenHome.pdf)

# Presentations

If you need a slide deck for a particular customer, feel free to contact us for your particular needs. Use the template
from the following slide deck for example. The deck itself is not just a template, but is about technology saving
us time.

# Documents

If you need a document, there is a template available. Rather than a template that has an ipsem lorum text, it describes
our mission, vision, slogan, legacy, and core values.

A presskit with all kind of materials like logo, icons, product pictures, and renders can be found at the [presskit page]({{ site.url }}/presskit).

# Insiders
