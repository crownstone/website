{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

To use and configure your Crownstones you need the Crownstone app, which is available for
**[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crownstone/id1136616106)** and 
**[Android.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rocks.crownstone.consumerapp)** 
The app will guide you through the process to register and set up your Crownstones.

## Dimming lights with Crownstone

Crownstones can both switch high-current devices as well as dim lights. A single Crownstone can dim lights from **0 to 100 W.**

Crownstones behind lamps with a switch

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin %}

{% include snippets/centered-text-home-begin background='light'%}

Crownstones can be installed at a light controlled by an ordinary light **switch**. The light can be dimmed directly with the app or via voice command. Flipping the switch will toggle between **“off”** and the last **“dimmed state”.**

Do not install the Crownstone between a **physical dimmer** and a light. It will dim the Crownstone rather than the light. This is **not supported** and might severely reduce the lifetime of the product.
