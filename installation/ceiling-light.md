# Crownstone installation

General instructions for the installation can be found in the [Installation page](/installation).
The instructions below will take you step-by-step through the process of installing a Crownstone behind a **ceiling light**.
If at any point you are unsure of what to do, stop installation immediately and contact an electrician.

*Step 1:* Before installing your built-in Crownstones, turn off the power at the **fuse box.**

*Step 2*: Unmount your ceiling light and connect the **wires** as shown in the **schematic** below.

**IMPORTANT**: The Crownstone is connected at the **ceiling light**, not at the switch!

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 3*: If you want to use your existing **wall switch** together with Crownstone, take a look at the [Switchcraft](/installation/switchcraft) installation instructions for more information!
Your setup is now finished, put the ceiling light back up and turn the power on at the fuse box.

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 4*: Open the Crownstone **app** to add your new built-in Crownstone to your Sphere.
Hold your smartphone in the vicinity of the ceiling light while your new device is being added to the app.
