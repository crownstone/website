# Crownstone installation

General instructions for the installation can be found in the [Installation page](/installation). 
The instructions below will take you step-by-step through the process of **switchcraft** installation.
If at any point you are unsure of what to do, stop installation immediately and contact an electrician. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Switchcraft is an easy adaptation of existing **wall switches**, allowing them to work together with Crownstones.
Switchcraft is a **bridge** between the two outputs of the switch. This will cause a very short interruption of the power when the switch toggles between the outputs. This is used as an **input** command.
If your wall switch supports traditional **multiway** switching (see diagram below), you can use Switchcraft.

*Step 1:* Before modifying your wall switches, turn off the power at the **fuse box.**

{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 2:* Verify the power is off by flipping the light switch on and off.

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 3:* Remove the switch button with a flathead screwdriver.

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 4:* Remove the framework around the switch.

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 5:* Unscrew the light switch from the mounting box.

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 6:* Pull the switch away from the wall to expose the wiring, but leave the wires connected.

{% include snippets/column-end %}
{% include snippets/row-end %}

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 7:* Bend the Switchcraft wire into a U-shape.

{% include snippets/column-end %}
{% include snippets/row-end %}

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 8:* Connect the **Switchcraft** wire to the two outputs of the switch.

{% include snippets/column-end %}
{% include snippets/row-end %}

![Step 8]({{ site.url }}/images/installation/switchcraft/step_8.jpg "Switchcraft"){: .img-center}{: style="max-width: 50vw"}



{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Note:* If you have an existing multiway switch installation, then connect the wires as shown in diagram (3).

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 9:* Close your switch after adding the **Switchcraft wire** and turn the power back on at the fuse box.

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 10:* Open the **app** and navigate to the built-in Crownstone that will be switched by your new Switchcraft switch. You have to specifically enable the usage of Switchcraft for each Crownstone in its **settings.**
