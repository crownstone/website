# Crownstone installation

General instructions for the installation can be found in the [Installation page](/installation). 
The instructions below will take you step-by-step through the process of **switchcraft** installation.
If at any point you are unsure of what to do, stop installation immediately and contact an electrician.

Switchcraft is an easy adaptation of existing **wall switches**, allowing them to work together with
Crownstones. If your wall switch supports traditional **multiway** switching (see diagram below), you can use Switchcraft.

*Step 1:* Before modifying your wall switches, turn off the power at the **fuse box.**

*Step 2:* Switchcraft is a **bridge** between the two outputs of the switch. This will cause a very short interruption of the power when the switch toggles between the outputs. This is used as an **input** command.
Open up your wall switch and connect the wires as shown in diagram (2). If you have an existing multiway switch installation, connect the wires as shown in diagram (3).

*Step 3:* Close your switches after adding the **Switchcraft wire** and turn the power back on at the fuse box.

{% include snippets/row-begin %}
{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 4:* Open the **app** and navigate to the built-in Crownstone that will be switched by your new Switchcraft switches. You have to specifically enable the usage of Switchcraft for each Crownstone in their **settings.**
