# Crownstone installation

General instructions for the installation can be found in the [Installation page](/installation). 
The instructions below will take you step-by-step through the process of **switchcraft** installation.
If at any point you are unsure of what to do, stop installation immediately and contact an electrician.

Switchcraft is an easy adaptation of existing **wall switches**, allowing them to work together with
Crownstones. If your wall switch supports traditional **multiway** switching (see diagram below), you can use Switchcraft.

*Step 1:* Before modifying your wall switches, turn off the power at the **fuse box.**

{% include snippets/column-begin colsize="12" %}

*Step 2:* Switchcraft is a **bridge** between the two outputs of the switch. This will cause a very short interruption of the power when the switch toggles between the outputs. This is used as an **input** command.
Open up your wall switch and connect the wires as shown in diagram (2). If you have an existing multiway switch installation, connect the wires as shown in diagram (3).

In the picture at the right, the **U-shaped bended** black wire represents the Switchcraft wire in a single switch (drawn in red in the diagrams at the left).

*Step 3:* Close your switches after adding the **Switchcraft wire** and turn the power back on at the fuse box.

*Step 4:* Open the **app** and navigate to the built-in Crownstone that will be switched by your new Switchcraft switches. You have to specifically enable the usage of Switchcraft for each Crownstone in their **settings.**
