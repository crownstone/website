## Company history

Crownstone, founded in 2016, is a company that combines indoor localization with building automation for homes and offices. 

Crownstone went through the Rockstart (<http://rockstart.com>) accelerator (demo day July 2016). We acquired a large network of business contacts, have a scrutinized business model and it ranks our company as a potentially disruptive and scalable player.

Crownstone has support from Almende as research company and from Almende Investments as investor. This guarantees that Crownstone can produce beyond state-of-the-art technology and has enough budget to grow organically. 

Crownstone's unique selling point is indoor localization. This has not been capitalized upon by any competitor in the home automation market, and only a few in the building automation market. 

There are already many people who have bought Crownstones. The Crownstones can be ordered at <https://shop.crownstone.rocks>.

## Product information

The Crownstone smart plugs and connectors save energy automatically when there are no people present and act according to the personal preference of people when individuals are present.

## Logo

![Crownstone Default Logo]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text_black.svg "Crownstone Default Logo, a Crown symbol by 5 dots connected through lines"){: style="max-width:40%" .float-right}

The following logos can be downloaded (see styleguide below). 

* A **black** logo with text in [Adobe Illustrator format]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text.ai).
* A **black** logo with text as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text_black.svg).
* A **white** logo with text as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_text_white.svg). Use only when there is a colored background.
* A **black** logo as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_black.svg). Use only when the brand name is already clearly presented.
* A **white** logo as [svg]({{ site.url }}/images/logos/crownstone_logo_white.svg). Use only when the brand name is already clearly presented and there is a colored background.

Do not use a colored logo! The **black** logo should always be the prefered logo. Only use the white logo if its necessary.

## Styleguide

![Crownstone Styleguide]({{ site.url }}/attachments/crownstone_styleguide.png "Crownstone Styleguide"){: style="width:40%" .float-right}

There are the usual considerations, just a few:

* Use a **black** logo on a **white** background, especially on products or material that does not benefit from color. 
* Logo is **white** on a blue background in the case where the logo really needs to pop out.
* Do not use the logo in any color. The logo is either **black** or **white**.
* Use **bands** over the full width, do not use a circle around the logo. 
* Only use a **few colors** in supporting photographs and use brand colors.
* The brand colors are a shade of blue, **#003e52**, and the complementary shade of orange, **#ff8400**.
* Use the orange shade as an accent, e.g. for line separation, emphasis, not as a primary color. 
* Use **Lato medium** as a font.
* Use the blue font on summaries or accentuated text. Use just a **black font** wherever possible for the primary text.
* In case where lighter shades of colors are required. Go to the [Adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=0&rule=Analogous&selected=3&name=My%20Color%20Theme&mode=rgb&rgbvalues=1,0.5176470588235295,0,0,0.23631049943210286,0.32156862745098036,0.5321115173241195,1,0.04999999999999993,0.8844330991828997,0.04999999999999993,1,0.050000000000000044,0.7437521349992267,1&swatchOrder=1,0,2,3,4). Click on "HSB" and adjust the second row. This will only adjust the **saturation** of a color, not the hue.

## Frequently asked questions

Q. Do I need to be close to a Crownstone to control it?

A. If you have multiple Crownstones they form a mesh network. If there is one Crownstone in your proximity they can forward the information to the entire network. It is also possible to control the Crownstone from online by leaving a smartphone or tablet at home.

Q. How accurate does a Crownstone measure my position?

A. A single Crownstone has an accuracy up to three to eight meters, just like an iBeacon. By using multiple Crownstones, the location becomes more accurate. If also the sensors on the smartphone itself are used, submeter accuracy is feasible. Our current software aims for room-level accuracy (around 1.5 meter or 5 feet).

Q. What devices does the Crownstone recognize?

A. The Crownstone measures both voltage and current. This allows it to measure not only power consumption, but also the type of load. Motors and transformers are reactive. Lights and heaters are resistive. The Crownstone also measures the current at a high frequency. This type of data characterizes a device. The types of devices the Crownstone can distinguish are lamps, fridges, electrical kettles, smartphones, and laptops, for example.

Q. What is the protocol used by the Crownstone?

A. The Crownstone uses Bluetooth Low Energy. This technology is directly available on a contemporary smartphone. The Crownstones can directly be controlled from your smartphone without the need for a hub. Moreover, the location of your smartphone can be used to turn off devices when you leave a room or turn on the lights when you enter a room.
