                <h1>Crownstone Plug</h1>
                <p>
                    The Crownstone plug has a sleek, round design that fits into any European power-outlet.
                    By keeping the aesthetics modest we've ensured it can visually blend in with any interior in any home.
                </p>
                <h3>Easy to Install</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the major benefits of the Crownstone is that it's easy to use.
                    Our built-in version can be built behind any power outlet, and our plug-in version only needs to be plugged in.
                    By using the accompanying app, controlling and monitoring your power outlets has never been easier!

                <p>
                    Next to our plug-in version, we also offer a built-in version. It's so small it can fit behind any power outlet. 
                    This way you can upgrade your house invisibly, while still getting the same comfort and safety as with the plug-in Crownstone.
                </p>
                <h3>Safety</h3>
                <p>
                    By using indoor localization to determine your presence, it doesn't just turn on when you're near,
                    it also turns off when you're away. Not only does this reduce your power consumption, it also doubles as a child-lock.
                    Knowing your child can't accidentally turn on a dangerous appliance when you're not in the room, increases the safety of your home and your peace of mind.
                </p>
                <h3>Smart Buildings</h3>
                <p>
                    Besides being used in personal housing, Crownstones can also be integrated in public buildings such as hotels and nursing homes.
                    There are many ways in which home automation can be beneficial for a multitude of enterprises.
                    Crownstone aims to make this available to everyone.
