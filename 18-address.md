# Directions within the building

To find the Crownstone office in the "Groothandelsgebouw", enter through the main entrance. Here, follow the 
directions for "Kleinhandel". This means, go to the first floor (there is a staircase next to the elevators).
On the first floor, the entrance to Kleinhandel is to the left with a door that opens automatically. Follow the
corridor all the way to the back of the building (you will pass several doors). Almost at the back of the building
you will see the Crownstone office at the right.
