				<h2>Crownstone</h2>
				<p>
				<strong>Smart</strong> buildings is both, observation and control: "See & Do". Although this becomes more mainstream, DoBots has been accelerating this research by developing the <strong>Crownstone</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Crownstone is a Bluetooth Low-Energy switching block that can be embedded everywhere in a building. Not only can people use their smartphones to control every wire in the building, but also the building knows where the people are. This means:
				<ul>
					<li>An audiotour through a museum adjusted to your preferences</li>
					<li>Directing people to the right track on a railway station</li>
					<li>An alarm service in a daycare center or hospital</li>
					<li>An office that shuts down all devices (except for fridges, etc.) at night</li>
				</ul>
				The combination of observation and control allows for services that satisfy both facility managers as well as end-users!

				<h2>A sneak preview</h2>
				<p>
				An early version of the Crownstone. It uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) which is currently supported by many smartphones. It allows people to opt-in for services provided at the location at hand. No secretive tracking!

				<h2>DoBeacon</h2>
				<p>
				The DoBeacon is an iBeacon on 230V, which can be plugged into a wall socket. This is the stripped down version of the
				Crownstone which will be available to selected partners.
				</p>
				<p>
				This technology enables you to do indoor localization as with normal iBeacons, but without having to be
				concerned with battery life, number of advertisements per second, or signal strength. For example the
				<a href="https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/203159703-Estimote-Beacons-technical-specification">
					Estimote</a> limits signal strength to save on battery life. There are also many iBeacons available
				that do not advertise as often as Apple demands (every 100ms) to save on battery life. Of course, outdoors
				mobile iBeacons might be very useful. However, for indoor localization or navigation fixed iBeacons are
				required and there are no real reasons not to connect them to a wall socket. At DoBots we have the expertise
				to power a device safely and efficiently from the grid.
				<p>
				If you want to organize a pilot for your customers that makes use of Crownstones in an indoor localization
				setting, please contact
				<script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/var a=new Array(".nl","bots","do","@","ne","an");document.write("<a href='mailto:");for(i=a.length-1;i>=0;i--){document.write(a[i])}document.write("?subject=Crownstone'>Anne van Rossum</a>");/*]]>*/</script>.
				</p>
				</p>
				You can download our <a href="/attachments/DoBeaconBrochure.pdf">brochure (pdf, Dutch)</a> to get more information about
				what the DoBeacon can do. Its main feature is that it an indoor localization infrastructure:
				<ul>
					<li>Optimization of cleaning. Clean based on room use.</li>
					<li>Improvement of safety and security. Alerts can originate from a particular room.</li>
					<li>Asset tracking. Track mobile iBeacons with the DoBeacons.</li>
					<li>Flexible working. Know how busy it is, or find out where a colleague is seated.</li>
				</ul>

				The sectors targetted at DoBots can be found at the <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/applications">applications page</a>.
				Note, that a smart building which combines automation with indoor localization opens up many possibilities
				in wildly different sectors. If you want to discuss specific markets, contact us. We cannot address all
				possible markets, and as hardware provider we can license you to build interesting software for your
				market on top of our crownstone product line.

				<h2>Smart Offices</h2>
				<p>
				A smart office (a bank, a courthouse, a helpdesk), knows how to treat her employees well.
				</p>
			</div>

					<h3>Energy savings</h3>
					<p>The entire building goes in sleep mode when everybody leaves. It's not just standby for a few devices such as screens and printers. However, this cannot be done without knowing which devices are in the building. A fridge cannot be turned off. The Crownstone can measure energy profiles of devices it is attached to and self-configure the network in a really smart way for energy efficiency purposes.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>People awareness</h3>
					<p>A lot of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems do not consider occupancy levels. Even less is the presence of people used for other purposes. To know if your colleagues is a meeting room, you'll have to go there and check it for yourself. Especially in bigger buildings, people quickly lose track of each other, reducing work efficiency. Also, an innovative work environment, such as a flexible floorplan becomes almost impossible to implement.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Communication</h3>
					<p>
					A smart office fosters communication between people residing in it. If a new person enters a building, an introduction mediated through the building infrastructure is not such a bad idea. The building can reserve a meeting room for participants, why would a participant be worrying about it!?

				<h2>Smart Buildings for the Elderly</h2>
				<p>
				Building automation and home automation are far-fetched for a random elderly person.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Alarm</h3>
					<p>
					An alarm button is a comforting thought. However, there are many more technological possibilities. To detect a fall, a noise meter would be efficient. Moreover, the alarm does not always need to call an emergence crew, but can gradually escalate. First, the older person is called, if necessary, a neighbour is called, then a caretaker, etc. in a logical order.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Passive sensing</h3>
					<p>
					An alarm button is not enough. An accident might happen with the alarm button is far away, or a person might get unconscious. Incorporating cameras is too intrusive, however, by just including a few sensors here and there: a door sensor, a bed or chair sensor (Dutch: "belmatje"), a movement detection sensor, so-called anomalies in the "activities of daily life" can be detected. Maximum comfort and minimum intrusiveness!
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Lights and devices</h3>
					<p>
					Most fire accidents with elderly happen with devices used incorrectly. The Crownstone detects power consumption and shuts off a device immediately. Warning someone is an easy next step. Control of lights at night is important as well. Many people fall due to the fact that it is dark at night. Automating lights are not just comfort anymore, they become life savers!

				<h2>Smart Museums</h2>
				<p>
				Interaction with visitors is especially important in museums and other buildings that tailor a (semi-)public service.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Audiotour</h3>
					<p>
					An audiotour entirely personalized towards the visitor's taste. A localised message per painting is no problem using the Crownstone. A visitor can perhaps even interact with an installation adjusting lights. A photo with flash is often prohibited in a museum, but buying a copy at that spot might be a nice alternative!
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Popularity and People Density</h3>
					<p>
					Which art works are visited most by people? What can be changed in rooms? Also exchange programs between museums can use this information. Security personnel can also benefit from knowing where most people reside in the building.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Air quality</h3>
					<p>
					The facility manager can benefit tremendously from a building with Crownstones. By adding Bluetooth sensors for humidity and temperature it is easy to monitor the air quality for the paintings. Moreover, these considerations can be seamlessly integrated with the knowledge on people density. A smart museum takes care of its customers as well as its art works!
